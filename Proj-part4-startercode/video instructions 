Hello welcome to my project tutorial/demo video 

In the video you will see the following. 
-me scrolling through the list of airports for origination and destination. 
-I will add some airports to the test file to also show that they come up and get added to the list boxes. 

-me hitting the search button which will output the flights that match from the test file.
-I will pick the same source and destination and show that no flights are found
-I will add some more flights to also show that they come up when searching

Those are the functionalties i was able to implement. 

There were some bugs as you saw with out of bound exception errors and random text popping up when compiling however that only happend some times while compiling which was wierd. 

Other than that I only outputed the flights and their sorce and destination I did not have time to also have it output price time etc which would be practically important from a passanger point of view. 

Thanks for watching!
